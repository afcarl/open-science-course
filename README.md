# Open Science Course
*things I would have liked to learn 20 years ago, knowing what I know now*

The call for practicing open science is resonating all over the world. Citizens groups, civil society agencies, scientific societies, activists, government organizations and funding agencies, all want scientists and their science to be open. Increasingly, there are innovative and helpful resources available for every step of the scientific information lifecycle. But one thing is conspicuous by its absence – training. We want our scientists to practice open science, but there is really no place they can learn how to do that systematically. This course aims to fill that gap.


## Lessons

### Course Outline

Please note, the [Course Outline](lessons/index.md) is not in the final sequence of instruction yet. Also, while all modules are important, one can pick and choose from the modules for a shorter course.

### Course Strategy

The course is designed as a series of modules of topics relevant to an open research lifecycle. Each module would take two “contact hours” per week.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> In the first contact, there would be a 20 mins long presentation to introduce the topic followed by 40 mins of a hands-on exercise. The course participants would be expected to continue working on the exercise on their own. In the second contact hour, the script would be flipped, with a 40 mins hands-on session where the participants present and discuss their work, followed by a 20 mins concluding presentation.
